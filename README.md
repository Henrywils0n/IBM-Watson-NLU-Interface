# IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding interface

The following app is deployed on IBM Cloud but I only have a lite account so odds are I will have terminated it.
Here is the URL:<br>
https://henry-645-sentiment-analyzer-proud-crane-hr.mybluemix.net/

To run locally

contact me for the Watson api key and URL
create and .env file in ```..../IBM-Watson-NLU-Interface/sentimentAnalyzerServer```

```API_KEY=<key>```
```API_URL=<URL>```

Set directory to Server
```cd ..../IBM-Watson-NLU-Interface/sentimentAnalyzerServer```

install dependencies
```npm install```

Set directory to Client
```cd ..../IBM-Watson-NLU-Interface/sentimentAnalyzerClient```

install dependencies
```npm install```

run build script
```npm run-script build```

Set directory to Server
```cd ..../IBM-Watson-NLU-Interface/sentimentAnalyzerServer```

start app
```npm start```

This will run the app on localhost:8080<br>
Have FUN!
